For years I wanted software to help manage my small HOAs. Something private, affordable, friendly, and easy to use. Something that would make life easier and better for everyone. I never found what I was looking for, so I built Our Little Community.

There are a lot of solutions out there for _large_ HOAs. The kinds of HOAs that are often managed by professional companies. These products consider 300-unit complexes to be "small." And price? You probably need to call their sales team to find out.

No thank you.

I built Our Little Community for the 32 home development where I live. And it's what I would have wanted at my previous 12 unit community, where I also served on the board for five years.

## Before Our Little Community

At my first 12 unit condo, the closest thing we had to a community website was someone's personal Google Drive to hold some of the community documents. But mostly we did everything by email. Which meant that pretty much everyone was in the dark. And community members had no idea how much work was getting done behind the scenes by the board! ðŸ˜… Oh, and that Google Drive that held the important documents? Yeah, that went away when its owner moved.

My second (and current) HOA was using Sharepoint as a community website when I arrived. That was better than nothing and actually had some nice features! People to send requests to the HOA board, for example. But it was ugly, it barely worked on a mobile phone, and, most importantly, it was difficult to use and update.

Eventually the guy who was maintaining it moved. When it came time to renew the Sharepoint subscription, the board and community didn't want to keep paying for it. So I volunteered to build a new website. I looked at a few options and ended up cobbling something together with WordPress. People thought it was an improvement over the old site. It looked nice and clean and worked well on phones! But it had plenty of issues. Making updates, like adding documents or adding/removing community members was finicky. If someone reserved the shared common area, I had to manually update the site to reflect that. WordPress is great for some stuff, but it wasn't really designed for what I was making it do. Frankly, I was annoyed every time I had to upload meeting minutes,

## Something better

I finally buckled down and built something from the ground up that was _focused on the needs of small HOAs_ and _easy for anyone to use and update_. The reaction was universally positive. The HOA board was happy with it. People liked using it. And, unlike the old WordPress site, I even liked working on it!

While I built it for my own community, from the beginning I knew that I was going to want to allow other people to use it. And that's what I'm doing. If this is something you are interested in, feel free to [sign up](https://app.ourlittlecommunity.org/users/sign_up) and check things out. It _will_ be a paid service, not more than $30/month. But I'll let you in on a secret: I haven't even built in a way for people to pay for it yet ðŸ¤£.

It's very early days over here at Our Little Community. Existing features will be improved, new features will be added. I'd love to have you along for the ride. [Let me know what you think](mailto:erik@ourlittlecommunity.org) so far!
