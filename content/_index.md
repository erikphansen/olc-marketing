title: Our Little Community
---

For years I wanted software to help manage my small HOAs. Something simple, private, and affordable. Something that would make life easier for everyone. I never found what I was looking for, so I built Our Little Community.

There are a lot of solutions out there for _large_ HOAs. The kinds of HOAs that are often managed by professional companies. These products consider 300-unit complexes to be "small" and often have "call us for a quote" pricing models.

No thank you.

By ignoring the needs of large HOAs, I was able to leave out the complexity that would bog you down. It offers a modest set of useful features tailored specifically for member-managed communities:

- A [community directory](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/directory) listing owners and renters (so neighbors won't be strangers)
- A way for the HOA Board and other committees to [handle requests](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/requests) (so information isn't lost in private email)
- A place to store community [documents](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/documents) (so everyone knows where the CC&Rs and [meeting minutes](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/minutes) are)
- A way to [reserve shared facilities](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/community-spaces) (if you happen to have those)

I built Our Little Community for the 32 home development where I live. And it's what I would have wanted at my previous 12 unit community. If you already know most of your neighbors' names (or you'd like to!), Our Little Community might be a good fit for you.

For about a dollar a day — $30/month, to be precise — your entire community gets access. There are no ads. Your info will never be sold or shared with any third parties. It's just me, a solo developer running an honest business.
