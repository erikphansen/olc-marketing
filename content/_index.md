title: Our Little Community

Keeping a small HOA running smoothly is hard. Community members have questions and requests. Documents need to be managed. You need to keep everyone in the loop and keep things from falling through the cracks.

Because professional management is too expensive and impersonal, small communities usually end up managing themselves. And because most HOA management software is made for large communities, small communities usually end up managing everything with email.

## Stop managing everything with email

Email is great because everyone has it and it's super easy to use. It's _not_ great because it's private and unstructured. It just isn't the best tool for managing a community.

Does the following sound familiar?

Someone in the community ends up being the go-to person. They are who everyone else reaches out to when there is a problem. People ask the same questions because they didn't see their neighbor asked about the same thing a month ago. The go-to person understandably get overwhelmed and frustrated. There is a general sense that no one really knows what's going on which leads to a sense of uneasiness. And when the go-to person eventually moves, they take their years of community knowledge (and important community emails!) with them!

## Communicate in the open

> "A community is best served when discussions are held in public" - [Mike Perham](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq#problems:~:text=a%20community%20is%20best%20served%20when%20discussions%20are%20held%20in%20public)

Our Little Community moves communication out of everyone's private email silos and into a space that's visible to everyone in your community (but completely hidden to anyone who _isn't_ in the community).

The longer you use Our Little Community, the more it becomes the central repository of community knowledge, and thus the more valuable it becomes. It's a great way for new members to find the information they need and get to know their neighbors.

## The features you need

Our Little Community offers a set of useful features tailored to the needs of small communities. If you already know most of your neighbors' names (or you'd like to!), it might be a good fit for you.

You can refer to the [Guide](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/) for more details, but here are the basics:

- A [community directory](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/directory) lists owners and renters (so neighbors won't be strangers).
- The [announcements](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/announcements) section keeps everyone in the loop. And serves as a historical record of things that have happened in the past.
- The HOA Board and committees have their own pages to [handle requests](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/requests) (so information isn't lost in private email).
- A place to store community [documents](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/documents) (so everyone knows where the CC&Rs and [meeting minutes](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/minutes) are).
- And if you want to allow people to [reserve shared facilities](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/community-spaces), such as a BBQ area or pool, you can do that, too.
