title: Our Little Community
---

For years I wanted software to help manage my small HOAs. Something simple, private, and affordable. I never found what I was looking for, so I built Our Little Community.

There are a lot of solutions out there for _large_ HOAs. The kinds of HOAs that are often managed by professional companies. These products consider 300-unit complexes to be "small" and often have "call us to ask about pricing" models.

No thank you.

By ignoring the needs of large HOAs, I was able to leave out the complexity that would bog you down. It offers a modest set of useful features:

- A community directory (so neighbors won't be strangers)
- A way for the HOA Board and other committees to handle requests (so information isn't lost in private email)
- A place to store community documents (so everyone knows where the CC&Rs and meeting minutes are)
- A way to reserve shared facilities (if you happen to have those)

I built Our Little Community for the 32 home development where I live. And it's what I would have wanted at my previous 12 unit community. If you already know most of your neighbors' names (or you'd at least like to), Our Little Community might be a good fit for you.

For about a dollar a day — $30/month, to be precise — your entire community gets access. There are no ads. There's no collecting unnecessary personal info or other creepiness. It's just me, a solo developer running an honest business.

The first 30 days are free, so [start setting up your community](https://app.ourlittlecommunity.org/users/sign_up). And I'd love it if you'd <a href="mailto:suggestions@ourlittlecommunity.org"> let me know what you think</a>.
