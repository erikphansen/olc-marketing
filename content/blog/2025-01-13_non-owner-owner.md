Just a quick follow up on [yesterday's post]({{< ref "2025-01-12_directory-vs-community-members" >}} "The Directory vs Community Members")...

There are cases where you might want to make someone an owner of a home even if they technically _aren't_ the owner. For example, if a home was purchased by Pat, but Pat's grown child, Chris, is the one who lives at the home full time, you might want to make both Chris and Pat "owners" of that home, as far as Our Little Community is concerned. This means both of them will get email notifications when [Announcements](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/announcements) or [Meeting Minutes](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/minutes) are posted and they can both [make requests](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/requests) and [reserve community spaces](https://guide.ourlittlecommunity.org/features/community-spaces). Depending on the situation, you might want to make Chris a renter instead. It all depends on the particular situation and how much access you want to grant Chris.
